Capstone 3 EasyShop, "E-Commerce API".

Description:

This capstone is an online store for a company named as EasyShop. In this project
we had a role of a backend developer for an existing website. This website
is already operational but has we had to add some improvements to it and also had
to debug the existing code of the website because the search and update part of
the website were not working the way they should've.

Testing:

During this project we had to use Postman to run our test and make sure that all
of them were in working condition. After importing the easyshop-solo file I was
able to get 9 of the tests working out of original 12 which mainly included GET,
POST and DELETE requests.

Overall Reflection:

I had most of my time working on the MySqlCategoryDao.java and CategoriesController,
we had to add them ourselves. On the other hand I also had to do some troubleshooting
on the code in the ProductsController.java since there was a bug. At first working
on testing in Postman was a bit difficult for me, but I thankfully got the upper
hand pretty soon.

The overall capstone was a nice experience for me as this class is coming to an end,
I really hope that I can retain as much information as possible weather it be from
my instructor or my fellow peers.
